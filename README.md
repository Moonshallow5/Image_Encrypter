# Image_Encrypter

## üí°Inspiration
14 bilion images are shared online on social media on any given day, and some of them might need some encryption. Thus, with my  image_encrypter rest assured, you can safely teansfer images from one place to the next with an ecryption key

## How does it work?

If you have an image you want to encrypt before sending it go the Encrypt tab on my Flask website. This would use a very simpel pixel manpulation algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the images.

First go to the Enccryption tab, and upload an image to be encrypted and then go to the Decryption tab and upload the encrypted image along with the key to decrypt the image.

## Challenges I ran into

The algorithm itself to encrypt and decrypt the imge isn't a very hard algo to implement as I using a very simple pixel- based manipulation. However, I focused more on the front-end part of this design, as I had to integret bootstrap.css with Flask to make a fully-functional website to encrypt and decrypt images for ease of use. Thus, the main challenges was utiling bootstrap.css and learning the documentation of Flask 

To run the code, download the zip file, run views.py and make sure you have flask installed in your system
